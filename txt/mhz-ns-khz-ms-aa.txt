Megahertz (MHz)  nanosecond (ns)  Kilohertz (kHz)  millisecond (ms)

  16 MHz = 16 million 'cycles' per second.

Each cycle:

 * starts at zero.
 * increases to maximum positive value, usually following a sine
   wave curve to get there.
 * decreases to zero.  cross zero into the negative range.
 * decreases to maximum negative value.
 * increases again, to reach the zero crossing.

 Normalized, this means you make one positive-going pulse during
 the cycle.

 You also make one negative going pulse, 180 degrees out of phase
 with the positive going pulse (at 1/4 and 3/4 of the cycle, in
 timing, with the convention that the cycle starts at zero and ends
 up back at zero).


 1 cycle per second = 1 Hz

 Distance between the pulses is 1 second apart, for either type
 (negative or positive pulse).

 You could call this 1 pulse per second and be speaking of the very
 same thing/idea.


 10 cycles per second = 10 Hz  (Hertz)

 Distance between the pulses is 1/10th of what it was for one Hertz,
 so it's 1/10 of a second apart.

 You may call this 0.1 second pulses, or, more conventionally, move
 the decimal point over three places, and refer to it as:

     100 milliseconds

     0.100 seconds  == 100 milliseconds (100 ms)

     1,000 milliseconds equals 1 second.

     1 millisecond == 1/1,000 of 1 second (0.001 seconds)


 So, a table can be constructed, beginning with:

       1 Hz == foo
      10 Hz == 100 ms

     100 Hz .. once again, divide by ten (from the previous
               iteration at 10 Hz).

 If 1 Hz means they are 1 second apart, and
   10 Hz means they are 1/10 of a second apart, then

  100 Hz means they are 1/100 of a second apart:

         1/100 = 0.01 seconds between successive pulses.

 0.010 seconds means the same thing as 10 milliseconds does.

       1 Hz == foo
      10 Hz == 100 ms
     100 Hz ==  10 ms

 So you can see that 'foo' should be replaced by
 1,000 ms (aka 1 second).

 That should be enough to propagate a table of values:

       1 Hz  1000 ms
      10 Hz   100 ms
     100 Hz    10 ms
    1000 Hz     1 ms



 FORMULA

     1 / f = something good ;)

     ex.   1 / 1000 Hz == 0.001 somethings.  What, exactly?

     1 / 1000 Hz == 0.001 seconds between two successive pulses
                         (from the crest of one wave to the next
                          crest over, on a graph showing how the
                          amplitude changes over time).

     0.001 seconds == 1 millisecond

     1 / 1000 Hz == 1 ms pulse-interval


     "An alternating current with a frequency of 1,000 cycles per second
      produces a pulse train with 1 millisecond spacing between two
      successive pulses."

     Though this would seem especially true, in the case of a
     square wave, it also applies to the general case, for any
     repeating wave-form (hereafter referred to as 'waveform'
     without the hyphen. ;)

     1 / 1000 Hz == 1 ms
     1 /   1 kHz == 1 ms (1000 Hz == 1 kHz)


     So, 1 / f (kHz) == t (ms)

     That is, take 1, and divide it by the frequency (in kiloHertz)
     to get the pulse interval in milliseconds.

 Microseconds

 Rather than get into fractional milliseconds, it becomes convenient
 to speak of microseconds.

     1 µsec == 0.000001 seconds (10 ^-6 or 1/1,000,000 seconds).

     1 µsec == 1/1,000 ms (0.001 ms)

     1 ms   == 1,000 µsec

     1 µsec == 1,000 ns (nanoseconds) (will get to this, later)

     1 ns   == 1/1,000 µs (0.001 µs)



This are good lookups for these, on Wikipedia.

Wikipedia gives it nine zeroes, and also lists it as 10 ^ -9 power.

So, 1 / 1,000,000,000 seconds:

1 / 1000 seconds is  1 millisecond

1 / 1000 = 0.001 second

1 / 1,000,000 seconds is 0.001 milliseconds and also is 0.000001 seconds.

1 / 1,000,000,000 seconds is 0.000001 milliseconds

1 / 1,000,000,000 seconds is 1.0 nanoseconds (ns)


Repeating the table from above:

      1 Hz    1000 ms
     10 Hz     100 ms
    100 Hz      10 ms
   1000 Hz       1 ms

      1 kHz         1 ms  (one kilohertz clock frequency gives pulses spaced 1 millisecond apart)

     10 kHz       0.1 ms
    100 kHz      0.01 ms
   1000 kHz     0.001 ms

      1 MHz     0.001 ms  (one megahertz clock gives 0.001 ms pulse spacing)
     10 MHz    0.0001 ms
    100 MHz   0.00001 ms
   1000 MHz  0.000001 ms

One nanosecond is also:
            0.000001 milliseconds

So, if no mistakes in propagation of the table have been
made, a 1000 MHz MCU clock frequency should be able to generate
one nanosecond pulse spacing (each pulse of a 1000 MHz clock
ought to be spaced one nanosecond apart).

Wikipedia says 10 ns is for 100 MHz and 1 ns is for 1 GHz, so the
above was corrected (a typo was found!) .. a mistake had been made
(and is now corrected).

1000 MHz is 1 GHz (one thousand megahertz is one gigahertz).

Now some translational values can be added to the table:


      1 Hz       1000 ms  1,000,000 µs   1.0 sec          1/1
     10 Hz        100 ms    100,000 µs   0.1 sec          1/10
    100 Hz         10 ms     10,000 µs   0.01 sec         1/100
   1000 Hz          1 ms      1,000 µs   0.001 sec        1/1000

      1 kHz         1 ms      1,000 µs   0.001 sec        1/1000 (Repeat)
     10 kHz       0.1 ms        100 µs   0.0001 sec       1/10000  or 1/10,000
    100 kHz      0.01 ms         10 µs   0.00001 sec      1/100,000
   1000 kHz     0.001 ms          1 µs   0.000001 sec     1/1,000,000

      1 MHz     0.001 ms       1000 ns   0.000001 sec     1/1,000,000 (repeat)
     10 MHz    0.0001 ms        100 ns   0.0000001 sec    1/10,000,000
    100 MHz   0.00001 ms         10 ns   0.00000001 sec   1/100,000,000
   1000 MHz  0.000001 ms          1 ns   0.000000001 sec  1/1,000,000,000

      1 GHz  0.000001 ms          1 ns   0.000000001 sec  1/1,000,000,000 (repeat)

This is not a set-up: did entirely forget about the unit known as the microsecond, or µsec.

1,000 nanoseconds – one microsecond
1,000,000 nanoseconds – one millisecond (ms)

from Wikipedia.

1,000 µsec is 1 ms is 1,000,000 ns
