Megahertz (MHz)  nanosecond (ns)  Kilohertz (kHz)  millisecond (ms)

  16 MHz = 16 million 'cycles' per second.

Each cycle:

 * starts at zero.
 * increases to maximum positive value, usually following a sine wave curve to get there.
 * decreases to zero.  cross zero into the negative range.
 * decreases to maximum negative value.
 * increases again, to reach the zero crossing.

Normalized, this means you make one positive-going pulse during the cycle.
You also make one negative going pulse, 180 degrees out of phase with the positive going pulse
(at 1/4 and 3/4 of the cycle, in timing, with the convention that the cycle
starts at zero and ends up back at zero).


 1 cycle per second = 1 Hz

 distance between the pulses is 1 second apart, for either type (negative or positive pulse).

 You could call this 1 pulse per second and be speaking of the very same thing/idea.


 10 cycles per second = 10 Hz  (Hertz)

 distance between the pulses is 1/10th of what it was for one Hertz, so it's 1/10 of a second apart.

 You may call this 0.1 second pulses, or, more conventionally, move the decimal point over three places, and refer to it as:

 100 milliseconds

 0.100 seconds  == 100 milliseconds (100 ms)

 1,000 milliseconds equals 1 second.
