Early draft - needs rework!


On March 21st the Sun is directly overhead at the Equator (any longitude) at Noon.

At the North Pole, the Pole Star (Polaris) is directly overhead.

At any Latitude, Polaris is above the North Horizon by the exact same angle as the local latitude.

These have consequences to the Sun's angle above the horizon at any latitude, at noon:

You stand at the North pole, where Polaris is (always) directly overhead.

Then walk South along the Meridian (of longitude) for your (home) city.

Before you begin, the Sun will be just on your local horizon (at the North pole).

As you walk South, the Sun rises above your local horizon (until you reach the Equator, at which time it'll be directly overhead).

So.

Take the angle of both Polaris and of the Sun, at noon, for your present location; the two angles add together to form 90 degrees (the Zenith angle).  As the Sun gains altitude, Polaris loses it by the same displacement angle.

Thus, either the Sun or the North star can provide you with your current latitude, by measuring the angle from the horizon to that object.

But there's a tiny bit of math:

At 60 degrees latitude, Polaris has already 'lost' 30 degrees of latitude, and the Sun has gained the same amount.

Measure the Sun angle at 60 degrees latitude; it'll be 30 degrees above your Southern horizon.

90 - 30 = 60 which is your latittude.

The same evening, take a sighting of Polaris; it'll measure 60 (degrees) above the North horizon at that same location.

```
Lat   Polaris   Sun
 90        90     0
 80        80    10
 70        70    20  70 + 20 = 90
 60        60    30  60 + 30 = 90
```
 
and so on.

Now add or subtract the Tropics, to get the Sun angles for June 21st and December 21st, at noon.


ON December 21st, the Sun is 'below' (south) of the Equator by 23 1/2 degrees (it's Winter in the Northern Hemisphere on that date, and surrounding dates).

If you were standing at the Equator on December 21st, and walked south 23 1/2 degrees (latitude) - when you got there, the Sun would (again) be directly overhead (90 degrees altitude above your horizon).

(Note: rework for the spring to summer situation, as the angles are easier to imagine for N Hemi dwellers)

Polaris would be 23 1/2 degrees 'below' your local Northern horizon.

```
Pole-to-Equator: 90
Equator-to-Sun: 23.5

Your latitude: -23.5 (south)
```

90 + 23.5 = 113.5 degrees, change of latitude from the North Pole (can't think of why this observation is useful, at the moment, though).


Next:

Put yourself at 40 degrees North on December 21st (with an interim step of September 21st time-frame):

Take September 21st figures (recorded) to get your local noon sun angle (facing south).  September 21st is the 'Autumnal Equinox' (Earth's so-called 'tilt' of 23.5 degrees is nulled out on this date, with respect to the Sun).


```
90 - your latitude = 90 - 40 = 50 degrees
```
(sun altitude at noon near New York City (very approximately) or Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (quite exactly).


Sun's altitude can't be 40, because 40 is Polaris' altitude (at 40 North for any day of the year, including 'our' September 21st under consideration, for Philly, PA).


That helps to anchor it firmly: Polaris' altitude always tracks your latitude, in the Northern Hemisphere  - the angles are exactly the same.

```
90 - 40 = 50
```
so that has to be the (remaining) angle, which is the Sun's altitude (on March 21st) at 40 North (latitude of Philly PA).


Stand on that spot (in Philadelphia) until noon, of December 21st (transitioning from Autumn to Winter).

The Sun got lower and lower at noon.  This is a fact of common experience, in Philadelphia, in Autumn turning to Winter.


On September 21st, at noon, the Sun's altitude in Philadelphia is somewhere around 50 degrees above the southern horizon.

September 21st, Noon, facing South:

```
90 - 40 = 50 degrees.

```
You aim your **pointy stick** at the Sun so that it casts no shadow; the angle of your stick is 50 degrees from the horizon (or your flat level table-top).

Wait for December 21st to arrive.

Each day the Sun got lower and lower at noon, until December 21st.

On December 21st, you have 90 - 40 (your latitude) = 50 (sun angle) less that 23.5 degrees of the Tropics (the 'tilt' of the Earth's polar axis).

```
40 - 23.5 = 16.5 - wrong answer.
```

Remember that this '40' is also the angle of Polaris at 40 North.  So swap in '50' (Sun angle at noon on September 21st) instead and it's:

```
50 - 23.5 = 26.5 - correct answer!
```

That's the Sun's angle above your local horizon (as a Philadelphia, PA visitor) on December 21st (of any year).

Similarly, for June 21st:

```
50 + 23.5 = 73.5 degrees - also a correct answer!
```

In Philadelphia PA on June 21st, at Noon, the Sun is ('way up there') at 73.5 degrees above the southern horizon.

IN ALL CASES the math boils down to:

90 (a constant) less your latitude (40 in the example) to get '50' - then just add or subtract the tropics (plus or minus 23.5 degrees) to get your local noon sun angle at your latitude, for the two Solstices (Winter, Dec 21st or Summer, June 21st).

At the Equinoxes, you just drop the Tropics term (plus or minus 23.5 degrees) and take the direct math between your latitude and '90'.

```
90 - 40 = 50 (sun angle)
```

For 50 north (Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada; or Prague, Frankfurt, Krakow):

```
90 - 50 = 40 (sun angle, Equinox)

40 - 23.5 = 16.5 (winter)
40 + 23.5 = 63.5 (summer)
```

Those are your two solar angle extremes for the year (in Prague, Krakow, or Franfurt .. as well as in Winnipeg).


**END**.
