NOTE!

  Some representative circuits found online show D and S reversed
  for the top MOSFET (closest to the Vcc +5 rail).

  The circuit, as shown, seems to satisfy Falstad in terms of
  an appropriate current draw; when D and S are reversed, way
  too much current flows.

  Some sources found online agree with Falstad sim of the situation
  (as depicted, here).

  Conclusion: circuit, as shown here, appears to be 'correct'. ;)
